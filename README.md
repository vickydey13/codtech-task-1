## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT : PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

### OBJECTIVE
Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

## Explanation:

Length Check: Ensures the password length is between 8 and 20 characters.
Complexity Check: Verifies the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.![Screenshot (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8725b0ca-c9bf-431c-9847-3c20e5912e15)

Uniqueness Check: Compares the password against a list of common passwords (in a real-world scenario, this should be more sophisticated).
